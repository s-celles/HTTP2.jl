# Changelog

All notable changes to HTTP2.jl will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and HTTP2.jl adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial import of the HTTP/2 implementation (frames, HPACK, stream state
  machine, connection lifecycle, flow control) from
  [gRPCServer.jl](https://github.com/s-celles/gRPCServer.jl) at commit
  `4abc0932`. See the **Provenance** appendix at the bottom of this file
  for the full per-file table, license-inheritance clause, and the list
  of files deliberately excluded from the extraction.

## Provenance

> This appendix is not part of the Keep-a-Changelog-formatted entries
> above; it is the provenance record for the initial lift-and-shift that
> created HTTP2.jl. It is kept here (rather than in a separate `NOTICE`
> file) so the record lives alongside the changelog entry it
> substantiates.

HTTP2.jl began as a lift-and-shift extraction of the `http2` submodule of
gRPCServer.jl. The production sources and their matching unit tests were
copied verbatim into this repository; the only modifications applied
during extraction were (a) rewriting the file-level header comment of
each source file to identify HTTP2.jl as its current home, and (b) in
test files only, rewriting `using gRPCServer` → `using HTTP2` and the
word-bounded identifier prefix `gRPCServer.` → `HTTP2.`. No other edits
were made. See `specs/001-extract-http2-module/research.md` (R3, R4, R8)
for the evidence supporting that this was a safe textual substitution.

### License inheritance

gRPCServer.jl is distributed under the MIT License. HTTP2.jl is also
distributed under the MIT License, with copyright held by Sébastien
Celles (see the top-level `LICENSE` file). Because both the upstream
project and HTTP2.jl share the same author and the same license, the
extracted code retains its original copyright and license unchanged: no
re-licensing occurred and none was required.

Any contributor who subsequently modifies the extracted files in
HTTP2.jl does so under the MIT License in force in this repository
(see `./LICENSE`).

### Exclusions — files deliberately NOT extracted at Milestone 0

The following files exist in the upstream project alongside the ten
files above but were intentionally left behind. Each exclusion is
recorded here per spec FR-010 so future maintainers can tell the
difference between "forgotten" and "deliberately excluded".

- **`test/TestUtils.jl`** — gRPC integration harness that builds a raw
  TCP/HTTP2 mock client scoped to the upstream gRPC test suite. Not
  used by any of the five HTTP/2 unit test files extracted here. Not
  planned for re-extraction; if HTTP2.jl ever needs a test helper of
  its own it will be written from scratch under the constitution's TDD
  rule.
- **`test/fixtures/hpack-test-case/`** — HPACK conformance vectors
  (go-hpack, nghttp2, python-hpack, raw-data). Not referenced by
  `test_hpack.jl` as currently extracted — the upstream
  Huffman/integer/string tests are hand-rolled. Deferred to Milestone 2
  (Frames & HPACK), which will pull in the vector set as part of the
  HPACK conformance push.
- **`src/http2/*.cov`** — Julia code-coverage artifacts (e.g.
  `hpack.jl.1286406.cov`) left over from upstream test runs. Build
  outputs, not source. Excluded by allow-listed copy; will never be
  extracted.
- **`test/unit/test_streams.jl`** — gRPC-layer stream wrapper tests
  (`ServerStream`, `ClientStream`, `BidiStream`). Exercises
  abstractions built on top of the HTTP/2 state machine, not the state
  machine itself. The HTTP/2 state-machine coverage lives entirely in
  `test_http2_stream.jl` and `test_stream_state_validation.jl`, both of
  which were extracted.

### Verification

The extraction and its post-conditions are verified by the step-by-step
walkthrough in `specs/001-extract-http2-module/quickstart.md`. In
particular:

- `rg -n '\bgRPCServer\b' src/ test/` — MUST return zero matches
- `find src/ test/ -name '*.cov' -print` — MUST return zero lines
- `head -n 1 src/*.jl` — every first line MUST end with `HTTP2.jl`

These checks were run at extraction time and passed; re-running them
from a fresh clone will reproduce the same results.
